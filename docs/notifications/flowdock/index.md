# Flowdock

The flowdock notification send to [flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/).

## Configuration

### Api token

You need define the API token.
It is purposely called Flow API Token and not Flowdock API Token to make
it more obvious for user which one of the two tokens we expect:

![flow token](flow_token_api.jpg)

### Sender ( not configure )

If you noticed default Gravatar icon in your Flowdock notifications you
may want to [add Errbit icon](http://gravatar.com) for email that is
set in ERRBIT_EMAIL_FROM.
You don't need to approve or authorize it on Flowdock because it is
used only for an icon.
